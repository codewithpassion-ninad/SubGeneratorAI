1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,388
Twin Twinkies.

2
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:06,994
Real education.

3
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:10,814
Tinku and Rinky were twin siblings.

4
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:14,934
They both studied in the same class in the same school.

5
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:17,182
Both were excellent in studies.

6
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:20,354
But often Tinku scored better than his sister.

7
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:31,914
Dad laid down a condition when both of them insisted on having a bicycle.

8
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:36,542
My budget allows me to purchase only one bicycle.

9
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:40,914
So whoever will score better between you two will get the bicycle.

10
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:45,674
After hearing father's words, both the kids started studying.

11
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:48,474
But Tinku was very smart.

12
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:51,194
He knew how to get good marks.

13
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:56,684
He used to study only that portion which was supposed to come in the exams.

14
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:01,112
Whereas Rinky was fond of studies.

15
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:04,084
She used to study the entire textbook.

16
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:10,364
Keep in mind, I will get the bicycle.

17
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,804
Whatever you are studying is useless.

18
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:15,496
This wont come in exams.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,924
How do you know?

20
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:18,944
See this.

21
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:23,464
Tushan sir has given me question papers of last three years.

22
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:26,660
Every time questions are repeated from these only.

23
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:27,500
Okay.

24
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:30,476
But I dont want to take any shortcut.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,504
Whatever will be the question, it will be asked from books.

26
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,132
Let me study.

27
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:37,428
Dont disturb please.

28
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:40,824
Both the kids started studying in their own style.

29
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:43,978
Finally exams were over.

30
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:44,950
Yay.

31
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:46,646
Exams are over.

32
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,230
We will have fun.

33
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:54,494
After a few days, results were declared and once again same thing happened.

34
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,270
Tinku was declared topper and Rinky stood second.

35
00:01:58,382 --> 00:01:59,154
Yay.

36
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:01,838
Now I will get the bicycle.

37
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:02,874
Hooray.

38
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:06,246
Bicycle was gifted to Tinku.

39
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,174
He was extremely happy.

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,142
Take this.

41
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:12,494
But keep in mind that this bicycle belongs to both of you.

42
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:14,326
Let Rinky also write this.

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,114
But Tinku did not listen to anyone.

44
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:20,434
He took his bicycle and ran away.

45
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:28,634
That same evening, to celebrate results of both the kids, entire family went out for dinner.

46
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:38,410
After finishing their dinner, when the family stepped out of the restaurant suddenly some people approached them with mic and camera.

47
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:41,174
We are doing promotion of g one bicycle.

48
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:44,162
We have a small quiz for the kids.

49
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:49,634
If you answer all the questions correctly then you will be gifted top model of ji one bicycle.

50
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,214
Along with this new bag and a bottle too.

51
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,410
Both the kids participated in the quiz.

52
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:59,810
Questions in the quiz were from their books only.

53
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:03,614
But totally different from examination paper.

54
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,958
Rinky had studied the book thoroughly.

55
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:11,474
Hence she solved all the questions of the quiz very quickly.

56
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:13,550
Please have this.

57
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:14,118
Uncle.

58
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:16,314
I have solved all the questions.

59
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:17,942
Thats impressive.

60
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:19,526
You did it very fast.

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,582
Very good.

62
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,446
Tinku tried very hard.

63
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,630
But he did not know the answers.

64
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:27,874
And at last he also gave the quiz paper.

65
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:33,314
After looking at both the papers, organizers announced the winner.

66
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:39,934
And in this quiz winner with hundred percent correct answer is Rinky.

67
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:46,774
Rinky was gifted cycle as prize along with other gifts.

68
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,094
Whereas Tinku learned a lesson.

69
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:58,974
Tinku now understood that we should not study for numbers only but for knowledge too.

70
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:03,204
Utilization of time.

71
00:04:03,664 --> 00:04:09,164
The one who utilizes time properly enjoys its wonderful benefits.

72
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:14,924
This happened with Sonu and Vani when their exams were near.

73
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:17,608
Hey, you are still studying?

74
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,124
Let's have some food.

75
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:22,056
Just little bit of project work is left.

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,416
Teacher will scold me if I didn't submit it.

77
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,888
And exams are also starting from next week.

78
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:32,396
Vaani was very hardworking girl who utilized her time appropriately.

79
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:39,468
Whereas her brother Sonu was very careless and naughty who used to leave every work for the next day.

80
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:41,104
Have you completed your project?

81
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:43,324
Why so soon?

82
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,996
We have to submit it in 6th period.

83
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,100
Two periods are still left.

84
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:51,180
I will finish it quickly now come fast.

85
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,508
I am feeling hungry.

86
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:53,924
We have to play also.

87
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,410
Hey listen Sonu.

88
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:58,014
Teacher will scold you if you dont submit it.

89
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:04,670
Sonu and Vaanis parents always used to teach Sonu by giving example of Vaani.

90
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:05,822
Listen my son.

91
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:07,646
You are no longer a kid anymore.

92
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,966
Along with games, you should focus on your studies too.

93
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,142
Yes maam.

94
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:13,030
From tomorrow.

95
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:13,718
Definitely.

96
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:18,446
Sonu, learn from your sister how to utilize time.

97
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,082
See, she studies on time.

98
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,698
Plays on time too.

99
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:26,106
She never leaves todays work on tomorrow.

100
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,282
You'll see.

101
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,474
I will do the same from tomorrow.

102
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,210
Can I play now?

103
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,054
Please?

104
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:37,654
Sonu always used to ignore advice of his parents.

105
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:42,130
And finally exam time came near.

106
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:46,374
Now only two days were left in Sonu and Vani's examination.

107
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:52,288
Kids, your exams will start from next Monday.

108
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:53,364
Am I right?

109
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:58,216
Study with all your heart and do very well in your exams.

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,216
Sonu, I am very worried about you my son.

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,968
You always leave todays work on tomorrow.

112
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:09,568
Dont leave studies for next day like Vani.

113
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,204
Study all your chapters on time.

114
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:14,228
Oh dad.

115
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:20,144
Till there are two days left for exams I will quickly study everything.

116
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:22,144
Now I'm going to play.

117
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:26,984
If I won't play, I won't understand studies too.

118
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:36,324
Hey Vaani, have a look.

119
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,388
Weather is so lovely.

120
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:39,604
Come please.

121
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,414
Let's play for some time.

122
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,454
You can study later too.

123
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:46,278
You will study everything very quickly.

124
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,662
Yes, weather is very lovely.

125
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:51,134
But I have to complete my studies.

126
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:52,654
Tomorrow is our exam.

127
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:56,074
You know it's really amazing to play in this weather.

128
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:58,134
You keep on studying.

129
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:02,254
I am going to play after some time.

130
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:06,470
Vani saw that the pleasant weather has turned into a storm.

131
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:09,566
And clouds were black everywhere.

132
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,044
It seemed rains could happen anytime.

133
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:21,392
Looking at this weather, Vani was worried that how will she complete her studies if rains happened.

134
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:25,364
Because power cuts were usual in this weather.

135
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,524
She called Sonu.

136
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:28,600
Sonu.

137
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:29,736
Sonu listen.

138
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,760
By looking at weather it seems rains are about to come.

139
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,896
Power cut may be there during night.

140
00000000,:07 --> 00:07:38,970
Stop all your games and come study now.

141
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:41,890
Otherwise what will you write in your exam tomorrow?

142
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,050
Don't worry vani.

143
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:45,018
It's just afternoon now.

144
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:49,490
I will study during night and will complete everything quickly.

145
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,570
Electricity won't go rest.

146
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:55,258
It would be more amazing to study after rains.

147
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:56,626
I have to go now.

148
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,922
My batting came careless.

149
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,490
Sonu as usual took everything very lightly.

150
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:11,174
He began to feel feel anxious when rains started suddenly Sonu was very nervous and now he returned home.

151
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:17,726
Upon returning, he saw that not only his house but whole village was facing parkat.

152
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,030
After seeing this, Sonu started to cry loudly.

153
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:23,926
What will I write in exams tomorrow?

154
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,470
I haven't studied even a single chapter and now electricity is also gone.

155
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,354
I will fail now.

156
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:36,994
I told you before, you should study on time.

157
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:42,070
I told you one week before also you should study on time.

158
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:44,514
But you never understood a word.

159
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,314
Now face it.

160
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,750
Sorry papa.

161
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,714
What should I do now?

162
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:54,634
Wish I could have completed my studies on time.

163
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:00,694
At last Sonu realized his mistake.

164
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,246
But there is an old saying.

165
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,646
Time and tide waits for none.

166
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,726
Crying now is of no help.

167
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,794
Hope you understand now why everyone used to explain you before.

168
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,994
Now stop crying and come with me.

169
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:17,286
I completed my studies on time.

170
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,780
Will make you understand and remember everything very easily.

171
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,128
Come next day.

172
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:26,504
Both the kids went happily to appear in exams.

173
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:32,144
One who handles present by utilizing time properly is surely the winner in future.
